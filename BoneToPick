Writeup of HacktoberCTF Crypto Challenge Bone To Pick

We are given a large text file claiming to be intercepted communication between two parties. 
It is fairly obviously base64 encoded, and has several areas where strings of text are repeated. 
I noticed a repetition of the base64 phrase
"gAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiii" 
so I ran the phrase "gAooooAKKKKACiii" through google search and boom, every match is a base64-encoded image file being sent across a network. 
At this point I used the handy website base64.guru to repair the output and convert it to an image file.
